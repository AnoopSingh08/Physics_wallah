    "  # the access and modification of data, ensuring data integrity and code organization.\n",

    "  # Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message or method call. \n",
    "  # It allows objects of different types to be treated as interchangeable, as long as they support a common interface or superclass.\n",
    "  # Polymorphism enables code flexibility and extensibility by writing code that can work with objects of different types without knowing\n",
    "  #  their specific classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary or complex details. \n",
    "  #  It provides a simplified view of an object or system, focusing on the relevant aspects and ignoring irrelevant implementation details.\n",
    "  # Abstraction allows programmers to work at a higher level of complexity, making code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.\n",

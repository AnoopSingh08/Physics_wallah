    "#     Efficiency: The tanh function is less computationally efficient than the ReLU family (including standard ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and Parametric ReLU) because it involves exponentiation and subtraction operations. ReLU variants tend to be more efficient due to their simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#     Output Range: The tanh function maps values to a range between -1 and 1, which can be useful in situations where you want your outputs to be centered around zero, as in some types of data normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, the tanh activation function is a variation of the sigmoid function that has a broader output range (-1 to 1) and is zero-centered. It introduces non-linearity into neural networks and can be advantageous in certain scenarios, such as when zero-centered activations are preferred. However, it shares some drawbacks with sigmoid, including the potential for the vanishing gradient problem, which can make training deep networks more challenging. The choice between sigmoid, tanh, and other activation functions depends on the specific problem, architecture, and desired properties of the network."

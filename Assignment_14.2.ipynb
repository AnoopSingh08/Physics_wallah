Our analysis shows that the months of July and August exhibit the highest average flight prices, indicating strong demand during the summer vacation period. Additionally, weekends, especially Saturdays, tend to have higher flight prices, suggesting that travelers prefer to depart on weekends. We also observed a correlation between higher flight prices and certain holiday periods, such as Thanksgiving and Christmas. Based on this analysis, we recommend focusing our marketing efforts on the summer months and weekends to capitalize on the peak travel season.\"\n",

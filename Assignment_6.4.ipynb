    "# Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that allows developers to build web applications quickly and with ease. It is known for \n",
    "# its simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility. Flask follows the \"micro\" design principle, providing only the essential components \n",
    "# needed for web development while allowing developers to choose and integrate additional libraries or tools as per their requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Simplicity: Flask has a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to understand and learn. Its minimalistic approach allows developers\n",
    "#    to quickly get started with building web applications without being overwhelmed by unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Flexibility: Flask provides great flexibility, allowing developers to customize and tailor their applications according to their \n",
    "#    specific needs. It does not impose strict conventions, giving developers the freedom to structure their projects as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Lightweight and Minimalistic: Flask is lightweight, meaning it has a small codebase and minimal dependencies. This results in faster\n",
    "#    application startup times and reduced overhead, making it suitable for both small and large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Modularity: Flask follows a modular design, allowing developers to use only the necessary components for their projects. This \n",
    "#    modularity makes it easy to add or remove functionality as needed, enhancing maintainability and reducing unnecessary bloat.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Extensibility: Flask provides a vast ecosystem of extensions and libraries that can be easily integrated into applications. \n",
    "#    These extensions cover various functionalities like database integration, authentication, form handling, caching, and more, enabling \n",
    "#    developers to leverage existing solutions and save development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, making it convenient for developers to run and test their\n",
    "#    applications locally without requiring additional server setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Active Community and Documentation: Flask has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development, provide \n",
    "#    support, and create helpful resources. The framework has comprehensive documentation that guides developers through various aspects of\n",
    "#    Flask development.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overall, Flask offers a straightforward and efficient way to build web applications in Python, providing developers with the flexibility\n",
    "# and control they need while maintaining a minimalistic and lightweight approach."

    "# App routing in Flask is accomplished using the @app.route() decorator, which is used to associate a URL pattern with a view function. \n",

    "#    Request Handling: App routes handle incoming requests from clients and determine the appropriate response to send back. By associating\n",
    "#    routes with specific functions, we can define the actions or operations to be performed for each URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Modularity: App routes make it easy to organize and modularize our application by defining separate routes and functions for different\n",
    "#    sections or functionalities. This enhances code maintainability and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Dynamic URLs: App routes can include variables and dynamic segments in the URL patterns, allowing us to handle different parameters\n",
    "#    or values passed in the URL and respond accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    RESTful APIs: App routes are commonly used in building RESTful APIs. Each route corresponds to a specific API endpoint, and the\n",
    "#    associated functions handle the corresponding API operations, such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.\n",
    "\n",

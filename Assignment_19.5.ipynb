    "# 1. Imbalanced Datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "#     Limitation: Accuracy can be misleading when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class significantly outnumbers the others. A model that predicts the majority class for all examples can achieve high accuracy but may be useless.\n",

    "# 2. Misclassification Costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "#     Limitation: In some applications, misclassifying one class may have more severe consequences than misclassifying another. Accuracy treats all misclassifications equally, which is not always appropriate.\n",
    "#     Addressing: Use cost-sensitive learning techniques or custom evaluation metrics that incorporate misclassification costs. For example, you can use weighted accuracy or specify different weights for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Class Priorities:\n",
    "\n",
    "#     Limitation: In certain situations, one class may be more important than others. Accuracy treats all classes equally, which may not reflect the real-world importance of classes.\n",
    "#     Addressing: Use weighted accuracy, class-specific metrics, or cost-sensitive learning to give more importance to specific classes.\n",

    "#     Limitation: Accuracy is straightforward to interpret for binary classification but may not generalize well to multiclass problems.\n",
    "#     Addressing: Consider using metrics designed for multiclass problems, such as macro-averaging or micro-averaging F1-score, or confusion matrices for a more detailed breakdown of performance by class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Threshold Sensitivity:\n",
    "\n",
    "#     Limitation: Accuracy is sensitive to the threshold used for classifying instances into positive or negative classes. Different thresholds can lead to different accuracy values.\n",
    "#     Addressing: Use metrics like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve or precision-recall curve to visualize model performance across various thresholds. You can also choose a threshold that aligns with your specific goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Model Confidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "#     Limitation: Accuracy does not consider the confidence level of predictions. Models might make correct predictions with low confidence, which may not be desirable in applications like medical diagnosis.\n",
    "#     Addressing: Evaluate model calibration using reliability diagrams or use metrics like log-loss or Brier score to assess the model's confidence in predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Data Quality and Label Noise:\n",

    "#     Limitation: Accuracy assumes that labels are completely accurate. In practice, datasets may contain noisy or mislabeled data, which can impact accuracy.\n",

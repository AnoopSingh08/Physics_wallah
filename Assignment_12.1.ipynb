    "\n",
    "# In the context of a confidence interval for a population mean, the margin of error is calculated as the product of the critical value (z-score or t-score) and the standard error (SE) of the sample mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Margin of Error (MOE) = Critical Value * Standard Error\n",
    "\n",
    "# The critical value is determined based on the desired level of confidence (e.g., 95%) and the distribution of the sample statistic (e.g., z-distribution for large sample sizes or t-distribution for small sample sizes). The standard error is a measure of the variability of the sample mean and is influenced by the sample size and the variability in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Sample Size Affects the Margin of Error:\n",
    "# As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. In other words, a larger sample size leads to a smaller margin of error. This relationship occurs because a larger sample provides more information about the population, resulting in a more precise estimate of the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Example Scenario:\n",
    "# Suppose we want to estimate the average time spent by students studying for an exam. We take two different samples, one with a small sample size (n = 50) and another with a large sample size (n = 500).\n",

    "# Small Sample (n = 50):\n",
    "# Sample Mean (X̄) = 4 hours\n",
    "# Sample Standard Deviation (s) = 1.5 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "# Large Sample (n = 500):\n",
    "# Sample Mean (X̄) = 4 hours\n",
    "# Sample Standard Deviation (s) = 1.5 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's calculate the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval for both samples using the z-distribution for large samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# For the Small Sample (n = 50):\n",
    "# Standard Error (SE) = s / √n = 1.5 / √50 ≈ 0.212\n",
    "#Margin of Error (MOE) = Critical Value * Standard Error ≈ 1.96 * 0.212 ≈ 0.416\n",
    "\n",
    "# For the Large Sample (n = 500):\n",
    "# Standard Error (SE) = s / √n = 1.5 / √500 ≈ 0.067\n",
    "# Margin of Error (MOE) = Critical Value * Standard Error ≈ 1.96 * 0.067 ≈ 0.131\n",
    "\n",
    "# As we can see, the margin of error for the larger sample (MOE ≈ 0.131) is smaller than the margin of error for the smaller sample (MOE ≈ 0.416). This demonstrates how a larger sample size results in a smaller margin of error, leading to a more precise estimation of the population parameter (average time spent studying).\n"

Additionally, z-scores help identify extreme or unusual data points in the context of the population's distribution.

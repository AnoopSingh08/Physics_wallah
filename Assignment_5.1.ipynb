    "# In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exceptional\n",
    "# condition arises, an exception object is created, which represents the occurrence of the exception. This object contains information about the error,\n",
    "# such as its type and the line number where it occurred.\n",
    "# Exceptions allow you to handle and respond to errors or exceptional situations in your code. By catching and handling exceptions, you can prevent\n",
    "# your program from crashing and provide meaningful error messages or take alternative actions to recover from the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The key differences between exceptions and syntax errors are as follows:\n",

    "#    Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are detected by the compiler or interpreter before the\n",
    "#    program is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Error Type: Exceptions represent runtime errors or exceptional conditions, such as division by zero, file not found, or invalid input. \n",
    "#    Syntax errors indicate mistakes in the structure or syntax of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing you to gracefully recover from errors and continue program \n",
    "#    execution. Syntax errors need to be fixed by correcting the code before running it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Execution Flow: Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of program execution and may cause the program to terminate prematurely if not handled\n",

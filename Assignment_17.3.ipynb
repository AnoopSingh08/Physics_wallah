    "\n",
    "#    Improved Predictive Performance: Ensemble methods often produce models with higher predictive accuracy and generalization ability compared to individual base models. By combining the predictions of multiple models, they can reduce errors and capture complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Reduced Overfitting: Ensemble techniques are effective in reducing overfitting, which occurs when a model fits the training data too closely and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. Ensemble models can mitigate overfitting because they combine predictions from multiple models, each of which may overfit differently.\n",

    "#    Handling Complex Relationships: Ensemble methods can capture complex relationships and patterns in the data that may be challenging for a single model to learn. By combining models with different strengths and weaknesses, ensembles can address a wide range of data complexities.\n",

It does this by training multiple base models (typically of the same type) on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions. Bagging is most commonly associated with decision tree models, but it can be applied to various other base models.\n",

    "#    Bootstrap Sampling: Bagging starts by creating multiple subsets of the original training data through a process called bootstrap sampling. In bootstrap sampling, each subset is generated by randomly selecting data points (examples) from the training dataset with replacement. This means that some data points may appear in multiple subsets, while others may not appear at all. These subsets are often referred to as \"bags.\"\n",

    "#    Predictions Aggregation: Once all the base models are trained, bagging combines their predictions to make a final prediction.

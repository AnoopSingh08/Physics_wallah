    "#Step 3: Determine the Number of Principal Components to Retain\n",
    "#Decide on the number of principal components to retain in the reduced dataset. This decision can be based on one or more of the following approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Cumulative Explained Variance Threshold: Look at the cumulative explained variance ratio of the principal components. A common threshold is to retain enough components to explain a certain percentage (e.g., 95% or 99%) of the total variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Scree Plot: Plot the eigenvalues of the principal components in descending order. Look for an \"elbow\" point, where the eigenvalues start to level off. Retain the components up to this point, as they capture the most significant variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Domain Knowledge: Consider the domain and the specific goals of your analysis. Certain features might be more important for the problem at hand, and you may choose to retain the principal components that correspond to those features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Model Performance: Evaluate the performance of your prediction or classification model with different numbers of principal components and choose the one that provides the best trade-off between complexity and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The number of principal components chosen to retain will depend on the specific dataset, the level of variance explained by the components, and the application or analysis requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Note: Since I don't have access to your actual dataset or the specific use case, I can't provide an exact number of principal components to retain in this particular scenario. You would need to apply PCA to your dataset, analyze the cumulative explained variance or scree plot, and make an informed decision based on your goals and domain knowledge. However, it's generally recommended to retain enough components to explain a high percentage of the total variance in the data while keeping the dimensionality reduction significant."
